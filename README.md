Email Classification and Order Processing Project:

Description:

This project is designed to automate the classification of emails, handle order requests, update product stock, and generate appropriate email responses for customer inquiries and orders. Utilizing OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 for natural language processing (NLP), the project automates the email classification process, identifies order requests, and processes product inquiries. This streamlines business processes and improves customer communication.

Project Features:
Email Classification: Emails are automatically categorized as either "product inquiry" or "order request" based on their content using OpenAI's API.
Order Processing: The project extracts product details and requested quantities from email order requests, matches them with available product information, and checks stock availability.
Stock Management: The project updates product stock based on processed orders and saves the updated product data.
Response Generation: Automated responses are generated based on the order or inquiry status (e.g., product availability or details).
Product Inquiry Handling: For product inquiries, a response is generated by retrieving the relevant product information from the company catalog.
Excel Integration: The project handles data storage and updates by reading and writing information to Excel files.
